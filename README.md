This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Router v6 related to unexpected routing behavior.  The bug manifests as routes seemingly being ignored or failing to match URLs correctly, resulting in unexpected page displays or blank screens. The solution provides a corrected implementation, highlighting the key fix.

**Bug:** Incorrect route configuration or missing elements can cause routes to be ignored.  This is often not immediately apparent during development, especially when combining nested routes or using wildcard routes.

**Solution:** The primary solution often involves meticulously checking route definitions, path declarations, and ensuring the correct components are associated with the intended routes.  Proper nesting and handling of wildcard routes are crucial.
